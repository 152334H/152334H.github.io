If you're reading this page, it means one of two things:

1. You intentionally saw the page titled, "TODO", and decided to check it out. Here it is.
2. You were on one of the normal pages of this site, clicked a hyperlink, and found yourself here inexplicably. The rest of this page is dedicated to you.

This is the null pointer node. It's the page that says, "That blog post you were looking for doesn't exist yet."

My blog notes form a vague, gestational [web of thinking](https://refinedmind.co/web-of-thinking). Although [some of my blogposts](/categories/ctf/) are isolated nodes, more often I have posts referencing posts referencing posts referencing... a dense graph with connections all over the place. Filling out the full details of the whole graph is difficult -- I'm a slow writer -- so I often make posts that reference incomplete, unpublished ideas.
