I don't think very often. These are some of the things I've tried in the past to rectify that.

#### Read (5) first if you're about pass out.

1. **Treat the problem seriously**.
2. **Surround yourself with conscious people**. You don't have a responsibility to stick around people who aren't.
3. **Don't sleep with comfort**. There is a minimum level of sleep required for health, which you can find the limits of by sleeping on the floor. Throw out the bed so you're not willing to buy a new one.
4. **Disable notifications**. Almost all pings are OK to drop. Ruthlessly prune them until you're left with what's necessary.
5. **Pinch yourself**. Bite your tongue, blink rapidly, slap your face, wash up, etc. Any trigger that resituates your awareness back to physical reality can help.
6. **Add barriers to distractions**. Uninstall apps, delete your accounts, add `/etc/hosts` lines, work in public, use speakers over earphones, destroy your online reputation && get banned, etc.
7. **Track your diet**. Odds are that there are obvious foods you should be blacklisting that are heavily correlated with mental unawareness.
8. **Ventilate**. High CO2 is mentally crippling.
9. **Exercise**. This one is obvious.
10. **Habitually write / speak your thoughts**. You should trigger this action on yourself with randomly scheduled alarms / popups if you are unable to consistently implement it of volition. Walk outside without a network-connected device if it helps.
11. **Seek novelty**. Emotional unfamiliarity kicks your brain out of auto-pilot. This has to be categorically unfamiliar; almost any action done on a chair in front of a computer does not count.

In general, you should do things that reduce the frequency and duration of fugue states, while extending periods of lucidity.
