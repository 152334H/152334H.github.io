Let's keep this short.

<!--more-->

2023 was the best year of my life. I went from being a conscripted nolife to having one of the best jobs in the world. I met people and went to places I would've never thought about, much less cared about, much less thought possible. I fundamentally escaped monotony, and pursued things that felt right but were baffling to my peers. I became financially well-off.

I also got lazier, and dumber. I reflect less and less on my beliefs, spend less time seeking out novel information, and generally lost all alpha. I allowed opportunities to die on the wire, ignoring the things that matter, in favor of staying relaxed. I suffered more tears, migranes, nosebleeds, eczema, cataplexy attacks, etc. this year than the last. I took the novel step of voluntarily seeking out doctors for health concerns (novel for me!), and found some help but not enough. I gave up on the last holdout of my personal philosophy that still mattered to me.

In short: materially & situationally way better; subjectively worse in spirit & health.

## Resolutions

What I want out of 2024, are 5 simple things:
1. Increased willfulness
2. Social Exploration
3. Better Health
4. Corrected Information Streams
5. Excitement for the Future

## Predictions

Nil.

I don't know anything especially secret or poorly reported about the future, anymore, so I cannot make probable-but-interesting predictions. This was a lot easier a year ago; past me nailed a lot in private chats. Current me is *extremely* confused about many different things, like:
* how does the moat hold?
* why'd stability win in court?
* what follows llms?
* when will the levee of VC OSS funds break?
* what are the current events going on in the external environment that actually matter

I can't even predict what I'll do tomorrow, much less what happens a year from now.

## History

Redacted.
