On 9th Feb, the [National University of Singapore](https://www.nus.edu.sg/) implemented [broad restrictions against the use of AI tools to generate work](https://web.archive.org/web/20230209131829/https://libguides.nus.edu.sg/new2nus/acadintegrity#s-lib-ctab-22144949-5):

> **1. DON’T USE AI TO PLAGIARIZE**
> The following are always improper uses of AI tools:
> * Generating an output and presenting it as your own work or idea.
> * Generating an output, paraphrasing it, and then presenting the output as your own work or idea.
> * Processing an original source not created by yourself to plagiarize it (e.g., using an AI paraphrasing tool to disguise someone else’s original work, or even the output of an AI tool, and then presenting the final output as your own work or idea).
> All of the above violate NUS policies on academic honesty and anyone found to have done any of them will be dealt with accordingly. Keep in mind that even though AI tools are not authors and thus cannot be harmed by someone stealing an idea from them, it’s still wrong of you to represent yourself as having produced something when you didn’t produce it.

I don't have much to say here. Papers have [already been published](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-00107-z) with ChatGPT as the author. The public stated plan of OpenAI is to make use of AI to [accelerate their research](https://openai.com/blog/our-approach-to-alignment-research/).  Institutions that refuse to accelerate their work with AI tools will inevitably be magnitudes less efficient than alternative institutions. Whatever talent that still remains in this country will be yet-more-convinced that expatriation is the only solution.

I might end up as one of those people soon.

This post was supposed to have 3 other parts. I have redacted them because I doubt my words would help to improve things.
